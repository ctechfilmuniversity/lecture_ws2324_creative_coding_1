### Task 01.01

Are there any open questions regarding the syllabus and the administration of this course? If so, please mention them next class.


### Task 01.02

Please answer the following questions truthfully so that I can setup the lecture accordingly.

* Overall, how would you rate your skill level of programming?
    * [ ] Never done it
    * [X] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* Have you used object oriented programming before?
    * [ ] I don't know what that is
    * [ ] I know the concept but I have never implemented it
    * [X] Yes
* Overall, how would you rate your skill level of using web technologies, such as JavaScript?
    * [ ] Never done it
    * [X] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* How would you rate your skill level of working with Git and GitHub?
    * [ ] Never done it
    * [ ] Novice
    * [X] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* Are there any specific topics that would interest you in the context of this lecture and that haven't been mentioned so far? *If not, you can skip this question.*
* Is there anything else that you would like me to know in regard to this class? *If not, you can skip this question.*



### Task 01.02

Are there any languages, tools or environments for creative coding that you know of and which are not included in the script? *If not, you can skip this question.*

### Task 01.03

Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project is of interest to you? 

*Bullet points as answer are sufficient.*

```
As a novice to text-based programming, I see great potential in learning creative coding. Generally, as a tool that gives me more control and creative freedom in future projects. Furthermore, to gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and object-based math. I'm especially keen on learning fundamental C++ for Unreal engine and hope to be well-prepared for that learning rodeo after attending CC1.
```

### Task 01.04

#### Option A

Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).

Answer:

[OUTERHELIUS - Free Jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0dOin79Hm0)
is a 10-hour archive piece of deepfake music that was live streamed on youtube 24/7 for many months starting in Janurary 2020. In their own words, the collective [DADABOT](https://dadabots.com/music.php) "... publish[es] research on
<s>eliminating humans from music</s>
neural synthesis" and recently released v1.0 of [stableaudio](https://stableaudio.com/). 

Even though audio deepfakes have recently become quite popular, I like how this particular dadaist project gradually takes away all meaning from the originally expressive music with every second that the IA model keeps synthisizing equivalent sounds. The endless generation of music designed to continue to infinity gives me a feeling of strange bewilderment and yet comedy. 

I think that this project represents creative coding because technically a neural audio generation model was trained using python and a self developed method of [neural synthisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06633). Furthermore, the output of the code does not fulfill a pracmatic function but rather generates creative content that raises qustions about [authenticity and definition of music](https://futurism.com/mind-melting-ai-frank-sinatra-toxic-britney-spears).

### Task 01.06

#### Level 2

* What is your setup and why does it work well for you?

    ```
    Usually, I use Github Desktop. I like that I can add and remove files to be staged swiftly with simply one mouse click. Similarely, fundamental operations are also quick: cloning repositories, fetching, pulling, committing, pushing as well as switching and creating new branches. Github Dsktp gives me a good overview of the commit history with all important information and for more complex operations such as merge and rebase I default to git bash. I consider myself a novice to text-based programming, therefore, I'll simply go with vscode as the development environment.
    ```

* Investigate something for your environment or GitHub that you haven't used before. Describe it briefly.

    ```
    I created a local repo for my TI course's Unreal project. Since Github Dsktp is primarely designed for online repositories, I now used git bash for the initializing and fundamental controlls. Now I'm learning how these are executed in code. It works well and I'm happy to utilize version control for my local projects now, too.
    ```
    
* Do you have any aspects, experiences, tips, etc. for working with GitHub that could be helpful to know for beginners?

    ```
    Even though, it's not the "real" way, I reccommend Github Desktop to all beginners. I believe this is the simplest way of bringing the non-intuitive workflow of git closer, especially in development teams that include artists that are not used to coding.
    ```

* Check with your classmates who do not have any experiences with GitHub yet and support them, if needed.

    ```
    I'm on it.
    ```

* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub?

    ```
    No questions for now.
    ```
