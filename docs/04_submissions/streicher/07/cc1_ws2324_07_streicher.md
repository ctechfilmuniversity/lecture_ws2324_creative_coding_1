In this session we are dealing with the topic of *asynchronism*, where we encounter it in every day life and what it means for us as humans. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to some web-specific JavaScript functionality and syntax, which we will need in the upcoming sessions.  


## JavaScript Functions & Asynchronism

### Task 07.01

Re-cap the sections in the script regarding higher order functions and their different syntax formats:

* [Higher Order Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#higher-order-functions)
* [Anonymous Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#anonymous-functions)
* [Arrow Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#arrow-functions)
* [Asynchronism](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#asynchronism)

At the very least make sure that you understand the underlying functionality and that you will be able to work with the syntax when given to you, e.g., from a framework. 

### Task 07.02 - Practice Higher Order Functions and Using the Browser Console

Re-cap the TODOs in the code comments in the given code file [`cc1_ws2324_functions.js`](cc1_ws2324_functions.js) and make sure that you can solve them on your own.

You can execute the file with `node cc1_ws2324_functions.js`.


## Debugging

### Task 07.03 - Reading

Read through the debugging script:

* [Debugging](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_07_debugging_script.md)

### Task 07.04 - Level 2

Do you have any additional tips, tricks and tools that help with debugging?


## Three.js

### Task 07.06 - Local Installation

Install node and npm and all needed packages locally. Use for Task 07.07 a local installation and submit your `package.json` (do not submit the `node_modules` folder!!)


### Task 07.07 - Your Own Scene


Unfortunately, hosting my script server crashed last minute and I counldn't manage to document visuals.


## Learnings

challenges:

- setting up npx vite server (this worked at the beginning but stopped working later on)
- working with randomized matrix

learnings:
- installing note js and installing it to a project
- using cubeLoader for environment textures
