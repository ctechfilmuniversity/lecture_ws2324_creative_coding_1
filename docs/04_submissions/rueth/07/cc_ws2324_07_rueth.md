In this session we are dealing with the topic of *asynchronism*, where we encounter it in every day life and what it means for us as humans. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to some web-specific JavaScript functionality and syntax, which we will need in the upcoming sessions.  


## JavaScript Functions & Asynchronism

### Task 07.01

Re-cap the sections in the script regarding higher order functions and their different syntax formats:

* [Higher Order Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#higher-order-functions)
* [Anonymous Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#anonymous-functions)
* [Arrow Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#arrow-functions)
* [Asynchronism](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#asynchronism)

At the very least make sure that you understand the underlying functionality and that you will be able to work with the syntax when given to you, e.g., from a framework. 

### Answer: DONE!!!!

### Task 07.02 - Practice Higher Order Functions and Using the Browser Console

Re-cap the TODOs in the code comments in the given code file [`cc1_ws2324_functions.js`](cc1_ws2324_functions.js) and make sure that you can solve them on your own.

You can execute the file with `node cc1_ws2324_functions.js`.

### Answer: DONE!!!!

## Debugging

### Task 07.03 - Reading

Read through the debugging script:

* [Debugging](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_07_debugging_script.md)

### Answer: DONE!!!!

### Task 07.04 - Level 2

Do you have any additional tips, tricks and tools that help with debugging?


## Three.js

### Task 07.06 - Local Installation

Install node and npm and all needed packages locally. Use for Task 07.07 a local installation and submit your `package.json` (do not submit the `node_modules` folder!!)

### Answer: DONE!!!!

### Task 07.07 - Your Own Scene

Create a Three.js scene up to your liking. There are no constraints for what the scene should be. The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality.

You might want to check the [three.js manual](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) for further functionality, such as [loading 3D models](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models), or from [useful libraries](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Libraries-and-Plugins).

Submit all required source files (scene, assets, `package.json`, etc.) and add or link result images in your submission file.


### Result:

For this task, I wanted to work a little more abstractly. In this scene I wanted to show several people sitting in a cold and harsh landscape worshipping a cube with donuts circling around it. This is meant to be a fun little reference to the Blender community. Every new Blender scene starts with a cube and almost every beginner has completed the famous donut tutorial at least once. The style is meant to be a vague reference to the artist [Stuart Lippincott](https://www.instagram.com/stuz0r/). 

(FYI: the human models are randomly selected from my harddrive)

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

#### Answer:

It was fun to finally incorporate some of my own 3D models into the scene. I also wanted to work more with imported animations as well, but sadly I could make it work until now. But I will definitely try it out soon! Nevertheless, I've learnt a lot. I just wish I'd had more time to implement more things.

#### Personal Learnings:

* installing three.js locally
* understanding the pipline (challenging)
* importing and working with custom 3d models (most models are from *sketchfab*)
* using Blender as *Previs* to think about the concept first
* using textures


#### Challenges:

* getting back into three.js after the winter break
* implementing an animated character
* understanding the local host setup (it didn't work for me for quite some time until I solved it)
* a bit frustrated about the outcome (due to time issues)
* sadly because of several other projects and the orientation project plan hand-in I was only able to put 9h into the homework...I probably could have fixed some stuff with more time
