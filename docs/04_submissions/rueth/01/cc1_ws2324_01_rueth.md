### Task 01.02

Please answer the following questions truthfully so that I can setup the lecture accordingly.

* Overall, how would you rate your skill level of programming?
    * [ ] Never done it
    * [X] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* Have you used object oriented programming before?
    * [X] I don't know what that is
    * [ ] I know the concept but I have never implemented it
    * [ ] Yes
* Overall, how would you rate your skill level of using web technologies, such as JavaScript?
    * [X] Never done it
    * [ ] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* How would you rate your skill level of working with Git and GitHub?
    * [X] Never done it
    * [ ] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* Are there any specific topics that would interest you in the context of this lecture and that haven't been mentioned so far? *If not, you can skip this question.*
* Is there anything else that you would like me to know in regard to this class? *If not, you can skip this question.*

```
I'm not sure on how to define my skills in progamming. I did some "basic programming" in the past, like really basic, with p5js and Processing, but it's been nearly 2 years since then and I basically don't have any knowledge about it anymore. That's why I was struggeling which of the two boxes I should tick when rating my programming skills, "Never done it" or "Novice".
```



### Task 01.02

Are there any languages, tools or environments for creative coding that you know of and which are not included in the script? *If not, you can skip this question.*

### Task 01.03

Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project is of interest to you? 

*Bullet points as answer are sufficient.*

```
- complete beginner in coding -> Still, I see great potential in acquiring this skill

- through my work in Motion Capturing/3D Animation I was able to see the advantages of how to implement coding in your creative process and projects
for example: to be able to create interactions between human and computer an let the visuals that you created be influenced by real life parameters

- learning code = it basically opens doors

- I would be interested to use the knowledge I gained in this class in process when working in 3D (a far-fetched example, but you could work in UE5 or Houdini with C++ or Python -> the knowledge of this course might make the first steps for that easier)

- I'm not sure how my final coding project could look like. But I think that I'll figure this in the coming classes and will do something that ignites my interests.
```

### Task 01.04

#### Option A

Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).

____

My answer:

[David Mignot](https://www.instagram.com/idflood/) is a swiss 3D artist and front end developer. He creates his graphic designs and artworks by using a Blender in combination with code (Python). You can find a small breakdown of his process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8hqLh_HE08).

Despite the graphical appeal of his projects, I really like his approach to his artworks and how he shows the audience what can be done with a little bit of code in a 3D programme. 

This is of course is not a "revolutionary technique". However to me it's a good example and a "friendly" introduction on you can level up your artistic skills with code.

### Task 01.06

#### Level 1

* With which tool / environment will you work with GitHub?
    * *I urge you to not simply use the basic functionality on the GitHub website (e.g. to upload a file). This might feel easier in the beginning but will not function later on...*

```
I would use the combination that you suggested in your scripts with Git Bash, GitHub and Visual Studio Code. A coursemate also suggested using GitHub Desktop and looks kinda approchable to me.

However, in all honest, I'm still struggling a bit with the setup. But I hope to get better with it for the next courses.

```
* With which development environment will you use?

```
Visual Studio Code
```
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub? 

```
Not for now, but I still have to get the setup running smoothly.
```


## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

```
Learnings:
- using GitHub and Visual Studio Code for the first time
- using Markdown for the first time and editing files with it
- getting familiar with the setup

Challenges:
- setting up the whole structure was/is kinda overwhelming -> but I'm far from giving up
- getting familiar with the new applications
```
