In this session we are dealing with the topic of *asynchronism*, where we encounter it in every day life and what it means for us as humans. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to some web-specific JavaScript functionality and syntax, which we will need in the upcoming sessions.  


## JavaScript Functions & Asynchronism

### Task 07.01

Re-cap the sections in the script regarding higher order functions and their different syntax formats:

* [Higher Order Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#higher-order-functions)
* [Anonymous Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#anonymous-functions)
* [Arrow Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#arrow-functions)
* [Asynchronism](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_04_javascript_script.md#asynchronism)

At the very least make sure that you understand the underlying functionality and that you will be able to work with the syntax when given to you, e.g., from a framework. 

#### Answer
Done! 

### Task 07.02 - Practice Higher Order Functions and Using the Browser Console

Re-cap the TODOs in the code comments in the given code file [`cc1_ws2324_functions.js`](cc1_ws2324_functions.js) and make sure that you can solve them on your own.

You can execute the file with `node cc1_ws2324_functions.js`.

#### Answer
Done! 

## Debugging

### Task 07.03 - Reading

Read through the debugging script:

* [Debugging](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_07_debugging_script.md)

#### Answer
Done! 

### Task 07.04 - Level 2

Do you have any additional tips, tricks and tools that help with debugging?


## Three.js

### Task 07.06 - Local Installation

Install node and npm and all needed packages locally. Use for Task 07.07 a local installation and submit your `package.json` (do not submit the `node_modules` folder!!)

#### Answer
Done! 

### Task 07.07 - Your Own Scene

Create a Three.js scene up to your liking. There are no constraints for what the scene should be. The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality.

You might want to check the [three.js manual](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) for further functionality, such as [loading 3D models](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models), or from [useful libraries](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Libraries-and-Plugins).

Submit all required source files (scene, assets, `package.json`, etc.) and add or link result images in your submission file.

#### Concept

Sunflowers are my favourite flowers. I like the idea of always facing the sun and that is what I tried to achieve. The mouse represent the sun and the flowers turn in order to face it and I also made the shadows follow the direction of the mouse so that it is clear that it represent the sun.

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

I've learnt a lot in this assignment! I've used ChatGPT to help achieve the turning movement of the flowers triggered by the mouse position and also for the shadows. I had to be very precise in what my idea was and how I wanted to achieve it and that made me also understand better the code that it provided to me, that I always had to adjust. 

three.js new learnings:
- how to locally install three.js
- how to work with 3d models
- how to work with shadows 
- how to animate the flowers and the lights with the mouse position
