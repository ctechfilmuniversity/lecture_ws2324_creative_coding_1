# Session 03 - Instructions (10 points)

Please complete this session by November 14th. Completing the session should take < 4h.  

In this session we are going to think about the topic of *instructions* and what the different forms in which instructions can be given. In terms of tech this session is about continuing programming with p5 and getting some coding done!

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

* Working with camera input interaction
* deeper understanding of coding starting from tutorials/sketches
* starting from an idea, I tried to write instructions to then write the code to achieve the initial idea
* I used ChatGPT to try to make something more elaborate. It was helpful because I had to have a precise idea of the instructions so that it could write the correct code. 
*programming is still a challange. I find it hard to work on big projects because I'm easily stuck on something. Instead I'm trying to have a deeper understanding on the smaller projects I work on.
