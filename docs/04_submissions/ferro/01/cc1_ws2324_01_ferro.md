## Syllabus and Administration

Read the [Syllabus](../../index.md) carefully and know how this class works and what I expect of you.

### Task 01.01

Are there any open questions regarding the syllabus and the administration of this course? If so, please mention them next class.

## Topics

### Task 01.02

Please answer the following questions truthfully so that I can setup the lecture accordingly.

* Overall, how would you rate your skill level of programming?
    * [x] Never done it
    * [ ] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* Have you used object oriented programming before?
    * [x] I don't know what that is
    * [ ] I know the concept but I have never implemented it
    * [ ] Yes
* Overall, how would you rate your skill level of using web technologies, such as JavaScript?
    * [ ] Never done it
    * [x] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* How would you rate your skill level of working with Git and GitHub?
    * [ ] Never done it
    * [x] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* Are there any specific topics that would interest you in the context of this lecture and that haven't been mentioned so far? *If not, you can skip this question.*
* Is there anything else that you would like me to know in regard to this class? 

  Over the years, I haven't dealt with programming properly. I just learnt what I needed depending on the project I was developing. I started a course on JavaScript, but I would say I've just stepped inot the "novice" phase. 


## Introduction

Recapture [Script 01 - Introduction](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_01_intro_script.md).

### Task 01.02

Are there any languages, tools or environments for creative coding that you know of and which are not included in the script? *If not, you can skip this question.*

### Task 01.03

Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project is of interest to you? 
* acquire programming skills, in class and self-tought through the assignments 
* explore the broad possibilities of creative coding
* implement the coding skills into my personal field of interests (visuals for example with touchdesigner) 
* as a final creative coding project, I had an idea of a web-based participatory game. but maybe I'll change my mind throughout of the corse of the lectures.
*Bullet points as answer are sufficient.*

### Task 01.04

#### Option A

Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).

## QUIPU PROJECT

[https://interactive.quipu-project.com/#/en/quipu/listen/intronode?currentTime=0&view=thread]

This is an interactive, participatory web documentary. It's about a sterilisation campaign in Peru. What I really love about this project, it's its interaction process. Not only the women are asked to tell their stories (voluntarly), but with the webdoc they are also able to listen to the other women involved. Moreover, as a listener, you can phone or add a message of support. The testionies are collected using a phone and translated with a system developed by the MIT Center for Civic Media and it's now an open source and free framework. I think it represents creative coding as it works on different kind of data and develops a different form of documentary, web-based and pertecipatory. 

here's is a video: [https://vimeo.com/112037914]

#### Option B

Come up with your own creative coding project idea of any scope (no worries, you don't have to actually implement it). Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe why you think the idea represents creative coding and why you want to do it.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).


## Setup

In summary, for the lecture you will need to be able to work with

* a development environment, e.g. Visual Studio Code,
* GitHub, and
* the console.

For this session, our goal is for all of you to know how to access and work with the course material. This implies an understanding of Markdown and GitHub and having a development environment ready.

### Task 01.05

Get a development environment, which includes accessing GitHub, ready and familiarize yourself with it as much as you can.

The scripts

* [Script 02 - Setup](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md) (Sections [Markdown](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#markdown) & [Development Environment](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#development-environment))
* [Script 03 - GitHub](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_03_github_script.md)

will help you to get there. It is up to you to decide how much effort you need to put in, to get your setup working. 


### Task 01.06

#### Level 1

* With which tool / environment will you work with GitHub?
    * *I urge you to not simply use the basic functionality on the GitHub website (e.g. to upload a file). This might feel easier in the beginning but will not function later on...*
    * I followed the script instructions and I'm working with Git, GitHub and VS Code
* With which development environment will you use?
    * Visual Studio Code
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub? 
  * Not for the moment

#### Level 2

* What is your setup and why does it work well for you?
* Investigate something for your environment or GitHub that you haven't used before. Describe it briefly.
* Do you have any aspects, experiences, tips, etc. for working with GitHub that could be helpful to know for beginners?
* Check with your classmates who do not have any experiences with GitHub yet and support them, if needed.
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub?

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

* I never used GitHub before, altough for some things I had to but I couldn't really understand it. I already feel much more confident than the first time that I tried to used it and I think it's a very powerful and useful tool.
* I am very fascineted by every example project that we have seen in class. I only knew the Jhonny Cash Project and I am excited to learn more about creative coding!
* I've also never worked with markdown, so I'm getting used to its structure. 
* I'm challenging myself with a lot of new tools, but I am a fast learner, I hope :)
