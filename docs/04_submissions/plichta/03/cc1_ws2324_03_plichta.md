## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

- First time using 3D in Unity
- Remembering and re-learning how to work with Comnponents and Classes, namely how to access a class from another component and using the sub-components.
- Learned about `Mathf.PingPong`
- Learned how to access single vertices in a mesh
- Learned you need to recalculate normals and bounds after modifying a mesh
- Learned it is better to re-use a mesh than instantiating and destroying it, but ultimately I didn’t have to do any of this since my operations never actually hit performance limmits
- Learning how to work with custom Meshes but the actual Mesh constructions is thanks to ChatGTP
- Learned how to use GUI Text in Unity
- Learned a few basics about lights and shadows in unity
