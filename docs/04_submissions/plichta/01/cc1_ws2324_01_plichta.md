## Introduction

Recapture [Script 01 - Introduction](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_01_intro_script.md).

### Task 01.02

Are there any languages, tools or environments for creative coding that you know
of and which are not included in the script? *If not, you can skip this
question.*

### Task 01.03

Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What
would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of
final creative coding project is of interest to you?

**Motivation:** My personal motivation stems from having experienced how
liberating it is to be able to execute your own ideas in code, at least to a
prototype state. Learning more about coding means having more creative control
over my designs to me and also being able to execute smaller ideas on my own.

**Idea 1: Friends Calendar:**
In the big city it's hard to spontaneously meet up with friends for me. You
never
know who is available and you end up writing a few people who already made
appointments. Or you don't write people because you expect them to be busy
anyway. It would be nice to have a timeline to see who is available at any given day (and
perhaps where they will be).
In business settings, colleagues can share their availability through shared
calendars to schedule meeting. But I haven't see an easy-to-use tool that is designed
specifically for your free-time and a small group of friends yet. This idea is perhaps
more like a traditional web-app and less like a typical creative coding project, but I envision the app
having a more playful and unusual UI than traditional apps. Also Berlin (and any capital) just needs this.

**Idea 2: A collaborative playground:**
A multiplayer toy where people can build an Rube Goldberg Machine in a stylised **_isometric_** view by stitching together components to form a track for a ball. The toy could be a pure creative collaborative toy, or a tool where you build a track to "challenge your friend", or perhaps a mix of track building and resource management.

**Idea 3: Keyboard Centric Swarm Game**
An interface-centric game where players control and manage a swarm of thousands of units almost simultaneously through a sophisticated UI controlled solely by keyboard shortcuts.
Players take on the role of a computer AI that sends out "antibodies" to defend itself against a hacker. Players control and manage the swarm via a novel interface that resembles a launcher app, such as [Quicksilver](https://youtu.be/M82lHcrYJBA?t=137) or [Launchbar](https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/videos.html). All of the game's options and data can be accessed using only keyboard shortcuts, but the player doesn't have to remember them by heart as the interface itself always shows all available options. The idea is to make the player feel like a "hacker" operating a (from the outside) seemingly complicated UI with swift key-combos.


*Bullet points as answer are sufficient.*

### Task 01.04

#### Option A

Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a
significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a
hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think
that the project represents creative coding.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).

**Wooden Mirror by Daniel Rozin (1999)**
In this installation, a matrix of wooden blocks is turned into a display. The blocks can display
a greyscale image through adjusting their angle with the help of small motors and either reflect
less or more light effectively becoming a dark or bright pixel. A camera in the center of the mirror
is used as
to capture a greyscale image and so the viewer can see themselves reflected
in pixelated form through the wooden blocks.

By modern standards, this is a fairly simple media installation, but I
appreciate its elegance and transparency. Even a layperson would likely
understand some aspects of the "magic" behind this installation, as the pixels
are mechanical and you can observe them up-close how they turn and create the illusion of an
image. Nonetheless, it remains interesting and visually appealing. What's even rarer is that it also
produces a pleasant and pleasing sound due to
the materials used.

#### Option B

Come up with your own creative coding project idea of any scope (no worries, you
don't have to actually implement it). Coding needs to play a significant role
for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement).
Describe why you think the idea represents creative coding and why you want to
do it.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).

## Setup

In summary, for the lecture you will need to be able to work with

* a development environment, e.g. Visual Studio Code,
* GitHub, and
* the console.

For this session, our goal is for all of you to know how to access and work with
the course material. This implies an understanding of Markdown and GitHub and
having a development environment ready.

### Task 01.05

Get a development environment, which includes accessing GitHub, ready and
familiarize yourself with it as much as you can.

The scripts

* [Script 02 - Setup](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md) (
  Sections [Markdown](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#markdown) & [Development Environment](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#development-environment))
* [Script 03 - GitHub](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_03_github_script.md)

will help you to get there. It is up to you to decide how much effort you need
to put in, to get your setup working.

### Task 01.06

#### Level 1

* With which tool / environment will you work with GitHub?
    * **For Git I will use a combination of my IDE's Git tool and Github Desktop. I will also use
      the
      Terminal a few times, just to get used to it more.**
    * *I urge you to not simply use the basic functionality on the GitHub
      website (e.g. to upload a file). This might feel easier in the beginning
      but will not function later on...*
* With which development environment will you use?
    * **I will use Jetbrains Rider and/or Webstorm.**
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub?
    * **Open Questions: Best practices how to resolve conflicts and merge when working in a team.**

#### Level 2

* What is your setup and why does it work well for you?
* Investigate something for your environment or GitHub that you haven't used
  before. Describe it briefly.
* Do you have any aspects, experiences, tips, etc. for working with GitHub that
  could be helpful to know for beginners?
* Check with your classmates who do not have any experiences with GitHub yet and
  support them, if needed.
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub?

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you
prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge
yourself?

**Git:**

- Learning to use ffmpeg (and being impressed by its' speed transcoding video)
- Learning that `-h` and `--help` is just the long version of the same command
- Using Rider's integrated Git instead of Github Desktop
    - Learning that some Git software can visualize something as a branch while in fact it was just two people pulling the same state and then committing at different times:

- Learning that you need to add `.gitignore` to gitignore
- Learning about best practices for commit messages

**Rider**

- Learning about different ways Rider and Github Desktop handle their workflow. In Github Desktop the prominent UI button is `Pull` and the app automatically does `Fetch` beforehand when it's opened. In contrast, Rider's Git Log features a button that only does `Fetch`, but you actually `Pull` outside the Rider's Log window. Before I realised that I ended up with a preview of commits in Rider's Log window, but not with the actual files in the File Explorer which was confusing.
- I experimented a bit further and learned to branch and cherry pick back from a local branch to Main.
- Using Markdown files in Rider the first time and learning about some settings to improve readability.
