# Session 06 - Space

Please complete this session by Dec. 5. Completing the session should take < 8h (4h CC1 + 4h TABG). Your results will be discussed in TBAG on Dec. 6.

## ⭐️ BREAKING NEWS ⭐️ 
For now, the coding tasks will be the same for CC1 and TBAG. Meaning, you only have to work on one practical exercise for both classes. You do not need to separate parts for each class but can submit one coherent project for both classes. If you enjoyed working in teams for the last session, you can also do these tasks in teams. But then, of course, the outcome has to be larger.

Please note that there might be additional tasks for each class individually.

In this session we are dealing with the topic of _space_ and what types of virtual spaces we are working with. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to the JavaScript library [`Threejs`](https://threejs.org/), which is a good choice if you want to build 3D scenes in a browser.

### Task 06.01 - Your First Scene

*This is the task that will count for both, CC1 and TBAG.*

Build a three dimensional, geometric scene. With geometric we mean that the scene should focus on abstract geometry. You could (but don't have to) find inspiration in the following art work.

For this task there is no need to go beyond the three.js basic elements that we have discussed in class. The scene should be navigable with (e.g., a simple orbit control but feel free to do something different) but other than that the scene should not include any interactions.
  
The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality.

Submit your JavaScript file and add or link result images in your submission file.


## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

* I'm now familiar with the basic building blocks of a three.js scene - scene, camera, geometry, lighting, rendering, etc. 
* I started exploring fractals, which I find fascinating. Originally, I wanted to implement a Mandelbulb following a tutorial, but then I decided to implement far simpler fractals without using a tutorial so I could figure it out myself - this is how I challenged myself this week. I now have a basic grasp of what fractals are and how they can be computed, and would like to continue exploring this field. 
* I used a little ChatGPT for animating the spheres. 
* I spent a lot of time tweaking the final output, adding ambient lighting and then removing it, playing with colors, fog, etc. I'm not 100% happy with the final output, but I'm stopping here as I've gone over the designated 8 hours for this task. If I had more time I would play around with lighting and different materials, as I find the spheres a little bland when observed up close.
