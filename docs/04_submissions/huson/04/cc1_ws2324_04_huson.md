# Session 04 - Connection (10 points)

Please complete this session by November 23rd, 10:00 (just before class). Completing the session should take < 4h.  

In this session we are dealing with the topic of *connection* and what the web means. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to p5 libraries and the different components a website is made of. Also, this will be the last exercise with p5 and in 2D.

## The Web 

Re-capture [Script 06 - The Web](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_06_web_script.md).

### Task 04.01 - Ingredient of the Web

Investigate and adjust the `.html` and `.css` of a p5 sketch of your choice. You need to make changes to both files and the changes need to be visible on the web page. Changes can be experimental, the outcome doesn't need to look good.

* Original sketch: [Sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/p5/sketches/Objects:_Composite_Objects)
* Sketch w/ HTML and CSS adjustments: [Adjusted sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/moe555/sketches/c3YsgZfyI)

## Connection

### Task 04.02 - Connection to the Outside

Let's start with connecting to each other. This task has to be done in pairs ðŸ¥³. I will try to dedicate some time to work on this task during next week's class (16.11.).

Create a sketch that uses some form of input live-stream. The easiest input is to use a webcam and it would be totally fine to simply do so. Creating a webcam feed can be done with [`createCapture()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCapture). For working with video, the [ml5 library](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/tutorials/hello-ml5) offers many interesting functionality extensions based on machine learning.

Submit a link to your sketch (or submit all source files) and add or link results in your submission file.

*On a side note*: Each team member should make a submission. However, those submissions can be identical (or one links to the other).

* Teamwork with Adam Streicher, link to his submission folder: [Adam's submission 04.02](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/lecture_ws2324_creative_coding_1/tree/main/docs/04_submissions/streicher/04/04_02_source_code)

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

* Learnt more about using ml5's library 
* Learnt how to use a class of properties (in this case a list of emojis)
* Was a lot of fun working with Adam and also a challenge to figure out the best way of working together. Who works on what? How do we work together using VSCode's Live Share extension? I sometimes found it difficult to verbally express the code I wanted to try, so that's something I want to get better at. 
* Getting the emojis to appear and appear at the right place took a lot of trial and error. It strengthened my resilience.
