# Session 03 - Instructions (10 points)

Please complete this session by November 14th. Completing the session should take < 4h.  

In this session we are going to think about the topic of *instructions* and what the different forms in which instructions can be given. In terms of tech this session is about continuing programming with p5 and getting some coding done!

## Instructions

Submit a text-based program and its result for each of the following instruction. Submit a link to your sketch and add or link results in your submission file.
  
*Note*: If you are using the p5 online editor, also submit your source code.

### Task 03.01 - *Coding*

> Circles!

### Task 03.03 - *Creative Instructions*

Write instructions that are in themselves a creative output.

1 - Preheat your bedroom room
2 - Carve time out
3 - Mix bedroom and time until smooth
4 - Get inside
5 - Choose the slowest path from one thought to the next 
6 - Sink further


## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

* I found the open ended questions challenging. I started going through p5js and ml5 tutorials, which ended up informing my sketches. In my previous studies in Computer Science, the custom was to program as much from first principles as possible, and to not use the Internet. So it was a weird feeling to rely on some external code for my sketches. I ended up learning a lot though: how to get and use sound waveforms, how to use the map() function and what callback functions are, although I'm still not entirely sure on some of the practical applications of it. Also, I started using ml5, which was a lot of fun. It got me really motivated to learn more about machine learning and its artistic use cases. 
* Time management was also challenging. I spent way more than 4 hours going through tutorials, etc. and neglecting some other courses. Maybe next time I'll stick to the programming shown in class and invest more time in some of the other courses. 
* I challenged myself especially on the Circles task and spent a lot of time on the map function and on sine and cosine.
