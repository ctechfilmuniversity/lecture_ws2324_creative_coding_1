## Syllabus and Administration

Read the [Syllabus](../../index.md) carefully and know how this class works and what I expect of you.

### Task 01.01

Are there any open questions regarding the syllabus and the administration of this course? If so, please mention them next class.

## Topics

### Task 01.02

Please answer the following questions truthfully so that I can setup the lecture accordingly.

* Overall, how would you rate your skill level of programming?
    * [ ] Never done it
    * [x] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* Have you used object oriented programming before?
    * [ ] I don't know what that is
    * [ ] I know the concept but I have never implemented it
    * [x] Yes
* Overall, how would you rate your skill level of using web technologies, such as JavaScript?
    * [ ] Never done it
    * [x] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* How would you rate your skill level of working with Git and GitHub?
    * [x] Never done it
    * [ ] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like
* Are there any specific topics that would interest you in the context of this lecture and that haven't been mentioned so far? *If not, you can skip this question.*
* Is there anything else that you would like me to know in regard to this class? *If not, you can skip this question.*



## Introduction

Recapture [Script 01 - Introduction](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_01_intro_script.md).

### Task 01.02

Are there any languages, tools or environments for creative coding that you know of and which are not included in the script? *If not, you can skip this question.*

### Task 01.03

Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project is of interest to you? 
* I am looking forward to a more hands-on approach to coding than during my CS studies - hopefully I'll be able to apply some of my theoretical knowledge to practical tasks
* would like to learn web development and am very interested in Progressive Web Apps. 
* be able to create a prototype of an idea fairly quickly
* learn how to deal with (real-time) data, start working with ML models 
* in terms of my final creative coding project, I'm interested in using real-time data to create meaningful visualisations and/or audio experiences. A different idea would be to create a GPS-based audio walk. 

*Bullet points as answer are sufficient.*

### Task 01.04

#### Option A

Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).

[A Strange Loop](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/19130) is a web-based generative art piece by Memo Akten and James Paterson. It is an audiovisual representation of a "strange loop": a concept coined by the cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter which aims to explain 'the mechanisms that give rise to the sensation of "I" - through hierarchical, self-referential, and at times seemingly paradoxical feedback-loops of abstraction and causality". The piece is aesthetically pleasing as much as it is conceptually sound - I enjoy art that I can enjoy on multiple levels, emotionally and intellectually, leaning into either mode of perception depending on the situation. I also like the way the visuals are enhanced and entangled with the audio, creating a compelling synergy. 

#### Option B

Come up with your own creative coding project idea of any scope (no worries, you don't have to actually implement it). Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe why you think the idea represents creative coding and why you want to do it.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).


## Setup

In summary, for the lecture you will need to be able to work with

* a development environment, e.g. Visual Studio Code,
* GitHub, and
* the console.

For this session, our goal is for all of you to know how to access and work with the course material. This implies an understanding of Markdown and GitHub and having a development environment ready.

### Task 01.05

Get a development environment, which includes accessing GitHub, ready and familiarize yourself with it as much as you can.

The scripts

* [Script 02 - Setup](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md) (Sections [Markdown](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#markdown) & [Development Environment](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#development-environment))
* [Script 03 - GitHub](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_03_github_script.md)

will help you to get there. It is up to you to decide how much effort you need to put in, to get your setup working. 


### Task 01.06

#### Level 1

* With which tool / environment will you work with GitHub?
    * *I urge you to not simply use the basic functionality on the GitHub website (e.g. to upload a file). This might feel easier in the beginning but will not function later on...*
    * I'll stick to VSCode and Git in the Terminal.
* With which development environment will you use?
  * VSCode
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub? 
  * Not right now. 

#### Level 2

* What is your setup and why does it work well for you?
* Investigate something for your environment or GitHub that you haven't used before. Describe it briefly.
* Do you have any aspects, experiences, tips, etc. for working with GitHub that could be helpful to know for beginners?
* Check with your classmates who do not have any experiences with GitHub yet and support them, if needed.
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub?

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?
* I finally started using GitHub, not just passively looking at repositories of projects I admire but using it for this class, which is a good start. Also, it was nice to see that Markdown is very straightforward, as I've only heard of it but never worked with it. 
* I challenged myself and tried to acquaint myself with the Terminal, which I've always meant to do but found daunting due to the fact that it's entirely text-based and visually... not very pleasing, let's say.
