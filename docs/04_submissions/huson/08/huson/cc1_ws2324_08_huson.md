# Creative Coding I

# Session 08 - Systems

Our last topic is *systems*. We are done with the class and hopefully from here on you have enough coding competencies and algorithmic thinking developed that you can build more complex systems - by using code, nodes, hardware... Also, hopefully you, yourself, can further evolve with what you have learned from this class (üêõ -> ü¶ã). 

## Task 08.01 - The Final Project 

The final project is an individually chosen project. 
  
*Maybe something useless?* üòÅ  
  
You can do whatever you want but your project must make use of text-based programming. It can also be an experiment, part of a larger project, work in progress, or a learning path. Ideally it should be something online, but this is not a hard requirement. You don't need to submit a project plan beforehand. However, it might help to discuss your plan with me in advance.  

The time dedicated to the final project is ~24h.

The official work period for the final assignment is Jan. 16th - Feb. 29th. The deadline for the final project is February, 29th.

* The deadline for the final project is strict and for a late submission, I reduce **15% of the total points**.
* If you are sick within the official work period, you can get a deadline extension based on a doctor's note ("Attest").

As submission, I require

* a description
* the source code
* a link to the build / online deployment or such, and
* at least one representative image.

Link to p5.js sketch: https://editor.p5js.org/moe555/sketches/Szg4yHKjy (where you'll find source code + a README description)

Submit your code in your assignment folder as assignment `08` or add a link there to where to find the code.


## Task 08.02 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)? --- 3
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)? --- 3
* How much did you enjoy working with p5 from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)? --- 4
* How useful do you consider p5 for you from 1 (don't need it) to 5 (will use it all the time)? --- 2
* How much did you enjoy working with tree.js from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)? --- 2
* How useful do you consider tree.js for you from 1 (don't need it) to 5 (will use it all the time)? --- 2
* What do you think about the context expansions, e.g., the brief general discussions of certain topics? --- 5
* Which one was your favorite topic, which one your least favorite? --- My favorite topic was emergence, can't say I had a least favorite topic. 
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one? --- Nothing missing for me! 
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!


## Task 08.03 - Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings **in regard to the whole course** (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?
* Got a good first grasp of JavaScript, p5js and three.js
* Because the vast majority of the tasks were open-ended, I improved my time management. I could spend endless hours on any one task, but it was important to know when to stop and work on other things that needed doing as well. 
* Because my background is mostly in programming, writing and music, I feel like I need to catch up a little on the visual side of things. This course helped me develop my visual sensibilities. 
* My CS studies were quite theoretical, so I really enjoyed working on my practical coding skills, which felt quite rusty at the beginning. Now I'm more confident again! 
* In general, my perspective on coding has changed: whereas in my previous studies, I was encouraged to work from first principles, I feel like the focus in CC1 is on output and how you got there is secondary. I want to strike a balance between the two. 
* I have a better understanding of web dev and I want to learn more. 
  
Bye-bye
