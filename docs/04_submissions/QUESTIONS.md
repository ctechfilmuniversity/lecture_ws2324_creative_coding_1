The code example at the button of the "Script 07 - Three.js" was very helpful for me to understand three.js. I only have the suspicion that the comments in line 101, 103, and 125 are not correct. Or is it me? ðŸ™ˆ

(Edit: in [cc1_ws2324_07_threejs_script.md](../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_07_threejs_script.md) it's lines 1163, 1165, and 1187.)
