### Task 07.07 - Your Own Scene

Create a Three.js scene up to your liking. There are no constraints for what the scene should be. The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality.

You might want to check the [three.js manual](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) for further functionality, such as [loading 3D models](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models), or from [useful libraries](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Libraries-and-Plugins).

Submit all required source files (scene, assets, `package.json`, etc.) and add or link result images in your submission file.

## Result

### Concept: 

I started this project on my way home for christmas,  so was inspired winter landscapes (that sadly where not present on the train ride). I wanted to do a scene that feels good to be in (but also really cold), to calm the viewer down and also tell a little story. "The lonely fire in the winter woods burns peacefully, but the creator of this fire is nowhere to be found, only their sword is left." To ad a bit of interactivity, you can blow in the fire to make it bigger! Maybe this could be a concept for a game as well, where you need to keep the fire burning in order not to freeze to death...

## Learnings

I learned a lot with this project!: How to code the snow (an array of particles), to randomly place the trees in the scene (but use a seed, so they don't change with the reload), to add spatial audio, to use sprite animations, to change the size of the sprites depending on the Mic input. I really challenged myself to make the scene look beautiful (despite the limitations of three.js) and finding a style that works. I spent some time on the sound design! Overall I spent way to much time on this, and watched way too many tutorials, but I also couldn't stop myself ðŸ˜… I like three.js a lot, even tho everything is complicated and takes for ever!
