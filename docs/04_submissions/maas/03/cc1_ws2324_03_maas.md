## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?
---
- I tried to develop a look that I like with texture and blur 
- experimented quite a bit until I found something I liked
- tried a 3D Scene in P5 with textures 
- this session the timing was the most challenging part, as I had a lot to do for the other corses. I learned that I am really bad with time management and should not spent to much time on a 4h coding session (even if I really enjoy it) ðŸ¥²
