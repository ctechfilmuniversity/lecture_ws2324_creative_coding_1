I believe that this task is best experienced first hand, because it is a pretty simple one, and if there is any *wow* or at least *a slight smile* effect, it can be experienced only once - after that it could get boring. But you should not worry - it is not much work! I have prepared it all in the `./src/jumpy-robin` folder. Just open the `jumpy-robin.html` file and all you have to do is follow the *instructions* and let your imagination *create* for you. As a next step, just click the button to see what you have created!

Unfortunately, I cannot provide visuals of the whole task, because it is a long one. But at least I can give you the main character below for you to enjoy.
