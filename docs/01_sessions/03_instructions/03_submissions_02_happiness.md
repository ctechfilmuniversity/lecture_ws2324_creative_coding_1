### Galina Angelova

I wanted to create a simple css illustration of a seagull, because the bird family *Laridae*, to which gulls (or seagulls) belong, is one of my favorite bird families, and in general, I love birds! 

If you want to bother the gull on your own, you can open the `seagull-fren.html` file in the `./src/seagull-fren` folder, and hover over its head. It is not used to many visitors, so don't mind the surprise. However, if you don't feel like it, here are some visuals.

#### Laser-Pointer Cat

Since I'm a huge cat lover, I thought it would be fun to play with cats through code! I wanted to create a situation where you play with your cat by using a small laser pointer which can be super funny. It was really interesting to figure out how to implement an image in p5js and make the rotation follow the cursor.
