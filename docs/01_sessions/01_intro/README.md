## Introduction

Recapture [Script 01 - Introduction](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_01_intro_script.md).

### Task 01.02

Are there any languages, tools or environments for creative coding that you know of and which are not included in the script? *If not, you can skip this question.*

### Task 01.03

Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of creative coding project is of interest to you? 

*Bullet points as answer are sufficient.*

### Task 01.04

#### Option A

Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).

#### Option B

Come up with your own creative coding project idea of any scope (no worries, you don't have to actually do it). Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe why you think the idea represents creative coding and why you want to do it.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).


## Setup

In summary, for the lecture you will need to be able to work with

* a development environment, e.g. Visual Studio Code,
* GitHub, and
* the console.

For this session, our goal is for all of you to know how to access and work with the course material. This implies an understanding of Markdown and GitHub and having a development environment ready.

The scripts

* [Script 02 - Setup](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md) (Sections [Markdown](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#markdown) & [Development Environment](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#development-environment))
* [Script 03 - GitHub](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_03_github_script.md)

will help you to get there. It is up to you to decide how much effort you need to put in, to get the setup working. 


### Task 01.05

#### Level 1

* With which tool / environment will you work with GitHub?
    * *I urge you to not simply use the basic functionality on the GitHub website (e.g. to upload a file). This might feel easier in the beginning but will not function later on...*
* With which development environment will you use?
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub? 

#### Level 2

* What is your setup and why does it work well for you?
* Investigate something for your environment or GitHub that you haven't used before. Describe it briefly.
* Check with your classmates that do not have any experiences with GitHub yet and support them, if needed.
* Are there any open questions for working with the course material and GitHub?

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?
