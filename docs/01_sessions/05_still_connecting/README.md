## Setup

### Working With a Local Server

Create a setup with a local webserver and be able to work with, e.g., p5, locally. 

* Install a local webserver with [the VSCode extension](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#webservers)
* Read through the [Example: A Local Setup For p5.js](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_02_setup_script.md#example-a-local-setup-for-p5js)

No need to submit anything, but I expect that you are ready to work with a local webserver from next week on.
