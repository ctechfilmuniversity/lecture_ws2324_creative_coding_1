# Session 04 - Connection (10 points)

Please complete this session by November 21st. Completing the session should take < 4h.  

In this session we are dealing with the topic of *connection* and what the web means. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to p5 libraries and the different components a website is made of. Also, this will be the last exercise with p5 and in 2D.

## The Web 

Re-capture [Script 06 - The Web](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2324_06_web_script.md).

### Task 04.02 - Ingredient of the Web

Investigate and adjust the `.html` and `.css` of a p5 sketch of your choice. You need to make changes to both files and the changes need to be visible on the web page. Changes can be experimental, the outcome doesn't need to look good.


## Connection

### Task 04.03 - Connection to the Outside

Let's start with connecting to each other. This task has to be done in pairs ðŸ¥³. I will try to dedicate some time to work on this task during next week's class (16.11.).

Create a sketch that uses some form of input live-stream. The easiest input is to use a webcam and it would be totally fine to simply do so. Creating a webcam feed can be done with [`createCapture()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCapture). For working with video, the [ml5 library](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/tutorials/hello-ml5) offers many interesting functionality extensions based on machine learning.

Submit a link to your sketch (or submit all source files) and add or link results in your submission file.

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?
